  - '...I used to have a shape.

    ...I used to have an identity.'
  - 'I feel like I have lost my existance.

    It''s funny, really.'
  - The more I grew, the less I felt like I even had a shape.
  - '''Square'' or ''circle''... '
  - I wonder what it would be like to fit in neatly with a distinction like that.

'
  - 'I''ll know.

    I''ll know what is at the ''root'' of who I am.'
